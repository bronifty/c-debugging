# WIP

we have a tailscale container working as a sidecar proxy with https and also funnel (internet) with mealie inside the ./tailscale-container folder.

we have a working ubuntu container with tailscale installed into which one may ssh as root without ssh keys.

## Current Issues

The ubuntu container is running as privileged. It would be better to configure it with specified capabilities like mealie has.

When the container is run without privileged it doesn't have access to the /dev/net/tun device.

## Next Steps

1. Try to configure the ubuntu container with specified capabilities using a compose file like mealie has.

2. Check the serverless setup instructions for aws lambda using a docker image to see if we can get it working like that. Here's the [tailscale serverless instructions](https://tailscale.com/kb/1113/aws-lambda).
