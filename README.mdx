# C Debugger Config for VS Code and Cursor

This will work for c and c++.

## How to use

1. Install the Remote Container Extension
2. Jump into the repo root with Dockerfile and .devcontainer folder and hit `cmd + shift + p` and select `Reopen in Container`.
3. Install extensions listed in the devcontainer.json file (c/c++ and lldb).
4. Open any c or c++ file and go to the debugger window (cmd + shift + d).
5. Click on the green play button to run the program (the configuration will be named "LLDB Launch").

## Notes

C++ is a superset of C, just extern C functions in C++ files due to the way C++ handles overloading.

```cpp
    extern "C" {
        void my_c_function();
    }
```

## Warning

The debug config relies on both of the vs code extensions. It will fail without them.
