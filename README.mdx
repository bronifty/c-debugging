# C Debugger Config for VS Code and Cursor

:::info
This will work for c and c++. You will need 2 ide extensions, one local (on your machine) and one remote (in the container).
:::

## How to use

1. Have the Docker daemon running on your machine.
2. Install the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) locally.
3. Jump into the repo root and hit `cmd + shift + p` and select `Reopen in Container`.
4. Install the [CodeLLDB Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) in the container (if not done automatically by the devcontainer.json config file in the root of this repo).
5. Open any c or c++ file and go to the debugger window `cmd + shift + d`.
6. Click on the green play button to run the launch configuration `lldb`.

## Notes

C++ is a superset of C, just extern C functions in C++ files due to the way C++ handles overloading.

```cpp
    extern "C" {
        void my_c_function();
    }
```

:::warning
You will be prompted to install the C++ extension in the container, but it is not strictly necessary with this setup.

## Debugging with LLDB

- lldb means llvm debugger; it hooks into the compiler architecture of llvm which is the next generation of compiler for c/c++
- clang++ uses llvm and is the compiler for c/c++
- a c/c++ file needs to be compiled with the -g flag to enable debugger metadata, which is then used by lldb
- the launch config does just what a terminal session would do but dynamically for the active file in the ide and it runs the build task (clang++ with -g flag) beforehand to enable debugging in the window for active file.

## Config

```json
// launch config
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "lldb",
      "type": "lldb",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}", // Current working directory
      "preLaunchTask": "clang++"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// build task
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "clang++",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "/usr/bin/clang++",
      "args": [
        "-std=c++17", // Specify C++ standard
        "-g", // Generate debug information
        "${file}", // Current file
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}" // Output executable
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
