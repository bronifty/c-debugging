# C Debugger Config for VS Code and Cursor

:::info
This will work for c and c++. You will need 2 ide extensions, one local (on your machine) and one remote (in the container).
:::

## How to use

1. Have the Docker daemon running on your machine.
2. Install the [Remote Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) locally.
3. Jump into the repo root and hit `cmd + shift + p` and select `Reopen in Container`.
4. Install the [CodeLLDB Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) in the container (if not done automatically by the devcontainer.json config file in the root of this repo).
5. Open any c or c++ file and go to the debugger window `cmd + shift + d`.
6. Click on the green play button to run the launch configuration `(LLDB) Launch`.

## Notes

C++ is a superset of C, just extern C functions in C++ files due to the way C++ handles overloading.

```cpp
    extern "C" {
        void my_c_function();
    }
```

:::warning
You will be prompted to install the C++ extension in the container, but it is not strictly necessary with this setup.
